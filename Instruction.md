Practice Machine Learning using KNN and Decision Tree

1. Use 'cancer_data.csv' dataset
2. For simplification, use only 'texture_mean' and 'concave points_mean' features with 20% test set and random_state = 42.
        - Features: 'texture_mean', 'concave points_mean'
        - Target: 'diagnosis'
3.  Find the best K value for the KNN model, then use  accuracy metric to evaluate the model's performance between KNN without and with scaling.
4.  Use the decision tree classifier model (max_depth = 2, criterion = 'gini'), then compare its accuracy against KNN, which one is better
